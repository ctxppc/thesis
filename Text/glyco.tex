\chapter{Glyco: A Nanopass Compiler for CHERI-RISC-V}

Glyco\footnote{From the Greek term $\gamma\lambda\upsilon\kappa{}o$ meaning \enquote{sweet}, alluding to the taste of a wild cherry.} is a compiler targeting the CHERI-RISC-V architecture, producing software running on CheriBSD systems and on a Sail-based emulator of the CHERI-RISC-V ISA.

We begin by giving a concise description of the nanopass compiler design, which is used for Glyco. We describe the design \& implementation of the base compiler, a compiler that emits CHERI-RISC-V instructions but has almost no additional features taking advantage of the capability machine proper. We do so using a few example programs, working our way from the high-end language to the machine language. A full language reference of the final compiler can be found in \cref{ch:grammar}.

Later chapters discuss extensions and changes to this first version of the compiler.

\section{Background: Nanopass Compilers}
Glyco is built following a \emph{nanopass} compiler design, described in the context of compiler education by several authors such as \cite{educomp} and in the context of commercial compiler development by authors such as \cite{commcomp}. A nanopass compiler consists of numerous small passes, so-called \emph{\glspl{nanopass}}, which translate one \emph{\il{}} to another. Source code is parsed into the compilerâ€™s first \il{}, which is then translated via \glspl{nanopass} through different \ils{}, ending up in the compiler's final \il{}. This final \il{} contains a string representation of the assembly code that is fed to the Clang compiler from the LLVM compiler toolchain for building \& linking an executable ELF file. This last step is unrelated to the research problem, hence this dependency on LLVM.

The nanopass design allows the compiler engineer to design and implement their compiler \emph{by iterated abstraction}. A simplified description follows. The engineer first chooses a target language (usually a machine language such as x86-64 or indeed CHERI-RISC-V) and determines an abstraction over it. The engineer then defines an \il{} that implements that abstraction as well as a \gls{nanopass} which transforms programs written in the new \il{} to the target language. The compiler engineer then repeats this process, this time abstracting over the \il{} with a new \il{} and \gls{nanopass}. This process goes on until a level of abstraction has been reached that can either be directly used as a source language (by human users), or be easily produced by parser actions.

An important benefit of the nanopass approach is each new iteration begins and ends with a working compiler. After each iteration, users can start writing and compiling programs in the new \il{} and unit tests can be written that ensure that the new \gls{nanopass} produces the expected transformations. For experimental architectures such as CHERI-RISC-V, this also means that designers can experiment more quickly with new ideas, something that may be harder to do on a full-fledged production compiler such as Clang.
