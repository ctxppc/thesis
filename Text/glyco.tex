\chapter{Glyco}
Glyco\footnote{From the Greek term $\gamma\lambda\upsilon\kappa{}o$ meaning "sweet", alluding to the taste of a wild cherry.} is a compiler targeting the CHERI-RISC-V architecture, producing software running on CheriBSD systems and on a Sail-based emulator of the CHERI-RISC-V ISA.

Glyco is built following a \emph{nanopass} compiler design, described by several authors in the context of compiler education \cite{:educomp} but also commercial compiler development \cite{:commcomp}. A nanopass compiler consists of numerous small passes, hence the term \enquote{\nanopass{}}, which translate one \il{} to another. Source code is parsed into the compilerâ€™s first \il{}, which is then translated via nanopasses through different \ils{}, ending up in the compiler's final \il{} (called Assembly, abbreviated S) that is simply CHERI-RISC-V assembly. Glyco then feeds this assembly to LLVM which builds \& links an executable ELF file. This last step is unrelated to the research problem, hence this dependency on LLVM.

Glyco currently defines 13 \ils{}. Each \il{} has a name and corresponding abbreviation, usually named after the abstraction it provides over the \lowerlang{}. Starting from the highest \il{}, these are:
