\chapter{Glyco}
Glyco\footnote{From the Greek term $\gamma\lambda\upsilon\kappa{}o$ meaning "sweet", alluding to the taste of a wild cherry.} is a compiler targeting the CHERI-RISC-V architecture. Glyco supports targets running on CheriBSD and on a Sail-based emulator of the CHERI-RISC-V ISA. Glyco is built following a \emph{nanopass} compiler design, described by several authors in the context of compiler education but also commercial compiler development. A nanopass compiler consists of numerous small passes, hence the term \enquote{nanopass}, which translate one intermediate language (IL) to another. Source code is parsed into the compilerâ€™s first IL, which is then translated via nanopasses through different ILs, ending up in the compiler's final IL (called Assembly, abbreviated S) that is simply CHERI-RISC-V assembly. Glyco then feeds this assembly to LLVM which builds \& links an executable ELF file. This last step is unrelated to the research problem, hence this dependency on LLVM.
