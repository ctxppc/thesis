\chapter{Glyco: A Nanopass Compiler for CHERI-RISC-V}
Glyco\footnote{From the Greek term $\gamma\lambda\upsilon\kappa{}o$ meaning \enquote{sweet}, alluding to the taste of a wild cherry.} is a compiler targeting the CHERI-RISC-V architecture, producing software running on CheriBSD systems and on a Sail-based emulator of the CHERI-RISC-V ISA.

We begin by giving a concise description of the nanopass compiler design, which is used for Glyco. We then describe the design \& implementation of the base compiler, a compiler that emits CHERI-RISC-V instructions but has almost no additional features taking advantage of the capability machine proper. We do so using a few example programs, working our way from the high-end language to the machine language. A full language reference of the final compiler can be found in \cref{ch:grammar}.

Later chapters discuss extensions and changes to this first version of the compiler.

\section{Background: Nanopass Compilers}
Glyco is built following a \emph{nanopass} compiler design, described in the context of compiler education by several authors such as \cite{educomp} and in the context of commercial compiler development by authors such as \cite{commcomp}. A nanopass compiler consists of numerous small passes, so-called \emph{\glspl{nanopass}}, which translate one \emph{\il{}} to another. Source code is parsed into the compilerâ€™s first \il{}, which is then translated via \glspl{nanopass} through different \ils{}, ending up in the compiler's final \il{}. This final \il{} contains a string representation of the assembly code that is fed to the Clang compiler from the LLVM compiler toolchain for building \& linking an executable ELF file. This last step is unrelated to the research problem, hence this dependency on LLVM.

The nanopass design allows the compiler engineer to design and implement their compiler \emph{by iterated abstraction}. A simplified description follows. The engineer first chooses a target language (usually a machine language such as x86-64 or indeed CHERI-RISC-V) and determines an abstraction over it. The engineer then defines an \il{} that implements that abstraction as well as a \gls{nanopass} which transforms programs written in the new \il{} to the target language. The compiler engineer then repeats this process, this time abstracting over the \il{} with a new \il{} and \gls{nanopass}. This process goes on until a level of abstraction has been reached that can either be directly used as a source language (by human users), or be easily produced by parser actions.

An important benefit of the nanopass approach is each new iteration begins and ends with a working compiler. After each iteration, users can start writing and compiling programs in the new \il{} and unit tests can be written that ensure that the new \gls{nanopass} produces the expected transformations. For experimental architectures such as CHERI-RISC-V, this also means that designers can experiment more quickly with new ideas, something that may be harder to do on a full-fledged production compiler such as Clang.

Glyco defines 20 \gs{il}. Each language is named after the new abstraction or feature it brings compared to the \g{lowerlang}.

\section{An Expression Language}
The highest \il{} in the first version of Glyco is called \textbf{EX} (Expressions), a language with basic support for arithmetic operations, functions, conditionals (if-then-else), definitions (let-bindings), vectors (fixed-size arrays), and records (collections of key-value pairs).

The following EX program computes the 30th number in the Fibonacci sequence starting with 0 and 1:
\lstinputlisting{Programs/fib.ex}

This program defines a function \texttt{fib} with three signed 32-bit integer parameters \texttt{prev}, \texttt{curr}, and \texttt{iter} and which returns a signed 32-bit integer. The function recursively adds the \enquote{previous} and \enquote{current} sums until the number of iterations drops to 0, then returns the \enquote{current} sum. The program itself is defined as the result of \texttt{fib} where \texttt{prev} is 0, \texttt{curr} is 1, and \texttt{iter} is 30.

EX is an \emph{intermediate} language and not necessarily a \emph{user-friendly} language; it is instead quite explicit and contains little syntactical sugar. For example, a value representing the constant 30 is written as \texttt{constant(30)}, the value of a variable or parameter named \texttt{iter} is written as \texttt{named(iter)}, and the predicate $ \textit{iter} \le 0 $ is written as \texttt{relation(named(iter), le, constant(0))}. A significant benefit is that the structure is easy to manipulate as the code goes through the compiler's \gs{nanopass}. One can, however, define a more user-friendly language and write a parser that emits EX.

EX is \lowered{} to \textbf{LS} (Lexical Scopes). LS does not support subexpressions so the \g{nanopass} binds all subexpressions to names and uses those names in place of the subexpressions. Our Fibonacci example now becomes:
\lstinputlisting{Programs/fib.ls}

LS is itself \lowered{} to \textbf{DF} (Definitions) which does not support shadowing. For instance, the following LS program defines \texttt{answer} twice but only uses the outer definition. Without shadowing, the program would evaluate to 28. The right answer is 42.
\lstinputlisting{Programs/shadowing.ls}

The \g{nanopass} to DF implements shadowing by renaming symbols such that each definition uses a globally unique symbol.
\lstinputlisting{Programs/shadowing.df}

Definitions in value position in DF are implemented using \enquote{computed values} in \textbf{CV} (Computed Values), which are values on which a computation can be attached. The previous DF program is \lowered{} to the following CV program without definitions, i.e., without let-bindings, and with \texttt{do} values instead:
\lstinputlisting{Programs/shadowing.cv}

Computed (\texttt{do}) values are themselves implemented by flattening them and binding the result to a name. The \g{nanopass} produces a \textbf{CA} (Canonical Assignments) program. The previous CV program becomes the following CA program, in which it's clear that the definition with value 28 is not used anywhere in the program:
\lstinputlisting{Programs/shadowing.ca}

A \enquote{value}, in programming language parlance, is a placeholder for a datum at runtime. In Glyco, a value is an abstraction that is introduced in CA and expanded in the aforementioned higher \gs{il}. Values are implemented using one of the effects that are available in its \g{lowerlang}, \textbf{CC} (Calling Convention). For instance, the CA program
\lstinputlisting{Programs/values.ca}
is \lowered{} as the following CC program:
\lstinputlisting{Programs/values.cc}
